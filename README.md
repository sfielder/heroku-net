# wimsite


Attached is my slide on .NET for Heroku, and the commands you see listed are the specific ones for the WIMSITE app repo. The login accounts to the existing wimsite app on heroku are listed below in case you just want to show them the site separately from deploying the repo to a separate site. I can have a dev who did this wimsite on the phone to support you through that as well.
